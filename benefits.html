            <h3>The Benefits</h3>
          <p>Green spaces are a very important part of any hospital system. There are not enough as is, with hospitals attempting to use green space to speed up their patient's healing process, the group decided to take this to the next level. A lot of these hospitals are built in very urban areas and are surrounded by grey instead of green. Not only has the group proposed green space within the hospital but also green space on the outside of the hospital, as the patients will most likely interact with both. Because of this, the team has decided that they will create a new hospital and place it on the experimental farm in Ottawa. 
          </p>
          
          <h4>Physical Health</h4>
          <p>There are many benefits to having a green hospital, these range from mental health all the way to physical health. A study was performed comparing respiratory health in children that are in urban green vs urban grey spaces. This study found that the children who were within green residential surrounding areas were at a reduced risk for bronchitis [1].
<br><br>
            However, this is just one of the many benefits of green spaces. Green spaces can actually boost the immune system; lower blood pressure; reduce stress; improve mood; increase the ability to focus; accelerate recovery from surgery or illness; increase energy levell; and improve sleep. Seeing these benefits, it is evident that green space is absolutely necessary for any hospital. 
            The above points are all ones that can benefit anyone at a hospital. Not only do these green spaces aid the patients, but they also will aid any of the employees and visitors that are in the hospital [2].
            <br><br>
            For example, generally, the hospital is related to sickness and overall is not a place that you wish to see yourself in. When visitors are there, there is a chance they will be visiting a sick individual. This might bring stress on that individual, with the addition of the green space they may be able to visit their friend/relative/etc within that green space or use that green space while they are there. This is a great way for that individual’s stress to be reduced and shows how not only patients benefit from the green space. 
            <br><br>
            Having green spaces outside the hospital is equally as important as having greenspace inside. A study was conducted in Pennsylvania with cholecystectomy (surgery to remove your gallbladder). This study had patients in their rooms with beds facing windows. Half of these patients were facing brick, and the other half green. These patients were of all body types to keep the experiment fair. Significant differences were found between the tree-facing patients and the brick-facing patients, with brick-facing patients having a longer stay time at the hospital at 8.7 days, compared to the green viewers at 7.96 days. In addition to this, the brick wall viewing patients had more negative nurse notes and had more notes of feeling upset and crying. 3.96 notes to be exact per brick viewing patients, while the green facing patients only had 1.13 notes per patient. The patients that were viewing green more frequently would receive weaker pain medications such as acetaminophen while the brick wall viewing patients would more be frequently using narcotics [3].
            Painkillers are becoming an increasingly larger problem every year with more people becoming addicted. In addition to this, there has been an increase in opioid overdoses every year, specifically since 1999 the number of overdose deaths has over quadrupled and just from the year 2018 to 2019 it increased nearly 5% [4].
            <br><br>
            Medical use of opioids can develop into serious long term addiction. It is always pushed that patients will use the lowest dose of opioids necessary for the shortest period of time necessary, however, the best case is if these opioids can be avoided completely. Anyone can become addicted to opioids which is why they are such a large problem [5]. 
            <br><br>
            As the patients who viewed green spaces instead of grey spaces on average used weaker pain killers and basic over-the-counter generic drugs, this can aid in the prevention of opioid addictions and death. The least amount of people on opioids the better, so if every patient were to be able to avoid opioids by spending more time surrounded by green and viewing green then that is another excellent reason to include green spaces in hospitals. 
            <br><br>
            Another study showed that well-planned green spaces can improve clinical outcomes through reducing pain medication intake and shorter hospitalization. Further proving that these spaces can reduce in opioid abuse. If the patient is in the hospital for a shorter period of time they are inherently going to be taking the medication for a shorter period of time [6].
            
            <br><br>
            Healthy, and routinely maintined green space can provide many benefits to the hospital eco system too. Well maintined green spaces will purify and trap more than 12 million tons of dust, soil and other particulate matter a year. This will protect both the health of the humans at the hospital and the wildlife around the hopsital. This is especially important in the City of Ottawa as it is an urban area with a lot of motorized vehicles and other polution. In addition to this, this will allow for those of the hospital and especially those with breathing problems at the hospital, to breath easier [7]. 
            Green spaces can moderate temperature increases in suburban areas. Trees, shrubs and lawn areas around the hospital can reduce the temperature through the cooling effect of the transpiration and evaporation of water through plant leaves. This would save the hospital a lot of money on air conditioning costs in the warmer months of the year. 
            Green spaces have a positive effect in the way that it is more likely for patients to want to get up and walk around or even get outside if there is more green space, these green spaces have been proven to promote physical activity among individuals [7]. 
            </p>
            <h4>Mental Health</h4>
            <p>
              More than just physical health, green spaces can also have a positive impact on mental health. As stated previously, a hospital is generally not a place that most people want to be in. The hospital experience has been described by patients to be very stressful, for many reasons such as it being an unfamiliar environment, and feelings of not being in control [8]. Feelings such as these can be detrimental to mental health, and can really harm an individual’s recovery process. It has been noted by many sources that mental health and physical health are highly connected to one another, and have a positive relationship with each other [9]. In other words, as mental health declines, physical health can also decline. When considering how important a persons’ health is within a hospital, it can be understood how serious it is to be able to take all measures and opportunities possible to improve it.
<br><br>
A greenspace within the hospital can give patients an area to recharge and escape, which may diminish many of the reasons as to why hospitals may affect mental health negatively. For example, feelings of being in an unfamiliar environment or not being in control may seem less prevalent when individuals are surrounded by a beautiful greenspace full of nature which they are more familiar with and more comfortable being in. There are various studies which have actually studied the impact of greenspaces on mental health, and have seen how strongly it can improve mental health.
<br><br>
A journal article by Barton and Rogerson [10] outlines all the points made above, and explores how important greenspace is for mental health. One of the first things it mentions is how greenspaces in an urban environment can improve mental health. When individuals living in urban areas who have no greenspaces were compared to individuals in an urban area who have greenspaces, it was seen that individuals with greenspaces had better wellbeing, less depressive symptoms, and less anxiety. 
<br><br>
This article also went over the ways in which greenspaces could be used as an intervention method. It has been seen that greenspaces can be effective as a therapeutic approach for various groups of people, such as individuals with dementia. For these individuals with dementia, using greenspaces as a therapeutic intervention method was seen to improve their eating habits, sleeping patterns, increase mobility, increase self-esteem and overall positively impact wellbeing. More than just the effects on patients, though, greenspaces have been seen to benefit everyone. It is mentioned that greenspaces have a positive impact on other groups of individuals such as  stressed employees. Therefore, it is evident that having a hospital design that prioritizes having greenspaces would be very beneficial for all individuals involved, whether it is the patients or the employees.
<br><br>
As it has been made abundantly clear within research that greenspaces are a beneficial addition to a hospital environment, researchers have moved onto examining what kind of environmental and landscaping factors are most beneficial and effective. A study by Chang and Chien [11] explores those factors, by using a hospital sample in Taiwan. In this study, they determine what kind of hospital landscape would be most well used by taking into consideration as to what speeds up a patient’s recovery the best and best improves the mental wellbeing of hospital employees. They do this by looking at what visitors of greenspaces needed and their intentions for engaging in a greenspace and what type of greenspace the visitors preferred the best. The major findings of this study was that equipment that allowed for fitness was deemed as most needed with trails and sitting benches within the greenspace to be the second most needed. Research results such as these were factored into our greenspace design, as we wanted to make a space that would maximize the benefits of having a greenspace within a hospital for the resources that were going to be used. 
<br><br>
Therefore, based on what we have found in research regarding the link between greenspaces along with physical and mental health, it is evident that an addition of a greenspace in a hospital would play a very beneficial role. As a hospital’s main goal is to improve health in the community, it only makes sense to invest in areas that would do exactly that. More than considering the base needs to keep individuals in good health, we need to consider what could be added to this environment to make recovery easier and faster, and to make sure that individuals’ health aren’t just good, but are thriving.
